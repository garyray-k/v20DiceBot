# V20 Dice bot
Vampire the Masquerade rolling bot for discord written in python.

## Requirements
This bot uses the [discord.py rewrite API wrapper](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py), you'll need to set that up for this bot to work. Be sure to use the 'rewrite' branch. (pip install -U git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py@rewrite#egg=discord.py)

Create a bot account using the [discord developer section](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me)


## Usage
Add your bot token in a file called `credentials.py`.

:exclamation: Make sure to insert your bots client ID in the url and add permission level.

Start the bot using `python v20bot.py`.

Roll dice using `!r 4 5` or `!s 4 5` where the first number is dice pool and the second number is difficulty.

`!help` is a good place to start too.

### Extra bits
Thanks to Rapptz for the discord.py wrapper.
